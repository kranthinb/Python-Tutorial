A set is a disordered collection with unique elements.
The elements in a Set cannot be changed (immutable).
Hence, a set cannot have a mutable element, like a list, set or dictionary as its element.
The set is mutable which means elements can be added, removed or deleted from it.

The main operations that can be performed on a set are:
Membership test
Eliminating duplicate entries.
Mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.
A Set can be created by placing all the items or elements inside curly braces {} each separated by a comma (,).

The "set()" built-in function can also be used for this purpose.
The Set can contain any number and different types of items - integer, float, tuple, string etc.

=======
Elements can be added or removed from the set but cannot be changed.
Set is a disordered, we cannot use indexing on sets. Sets do not support indexing.

numset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2}
print(numset)
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

numset2 = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5])
print(numset2)
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

emptyset = set()
print(type(emptyset)



Another type of set exists called the frozenset which is an immutable set (which means addition/deletion/removal of elements is not possible.)
cities = frozenset(["Hyderabad", "Bengaluru", "Pune", "Kochi"])
print(type(cities))     //<class 'frozenset'>
